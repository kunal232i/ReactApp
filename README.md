# Noty - Note Taking Frontend Application

Noty is a simple and user-friendly note-taking frontend application built using React. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state and interacts with the browser's `localStorage` to temporarily store the notes data since it doesn't have a backend or database.
